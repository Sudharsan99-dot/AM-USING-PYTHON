## Apparatus Required
Software : PythonwithNumPyandMatplotlib libraries
Hardware : PersonalComputer
## Theory
Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication, primarily for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude ofthe carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal. The general form of an AM signal is:
